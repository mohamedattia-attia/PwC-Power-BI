# PwC Power-BI in Data Analytics Project

PwC, which stands for PricewaterhouseCoopers, is one of the leading professional services networks in the world, offering services in audit, advisory, and tax. This project involves creating visualizations and analyses based on real-world datasets to gain insights into various business aspects, including call center performance, customer retention, and HR diversity and inclusion.

### Summary

This project consists of three case studies on different datasets, helping to understand business scenarios and solve business problems.

#### Call Centre Trends
This case study analyzes the number of incoming calls, call agent performance, speed of answer, call duration, trends on a daily and hourly basis, and customer satisfaction ratings. The goal is to identify opportunities to enhance performance and customer satisfaction.
